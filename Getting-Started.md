If you are new to RRest it is recommended that you follow these steps to gain familiarity with the toolbox:

## Download a sample dataset
Several datasets are compatible with the toolbox (as listed [here](http://peterhcharlton.github.io/RRest/datasets.html)). Of these, the 'CapnoBase' dataset is perhaps the easiest one to start with. To download the dataset use the Matlab script which is provided. This downloads the dataset and formats it appropriately for use with the toolbox (further details are given here).

## Amend the Universal Parameters


## Run your first analysis
