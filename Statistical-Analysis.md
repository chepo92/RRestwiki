The toolbox provides a range of statistics to assess the performance of RR algorithms against reference RRs:

## Limits of Agreement analysis
The toolbox calculates the limits of agreement between an algorithm's estimated RRs and the reference RRs using the technique reported by Bland-Altman [ref](http://doi.org/10.1080/10543400701329422), accounting for repeated measures from individual subjects. The results are given as the **bias** and **limits of agreement** in the _BA_results_table_.
