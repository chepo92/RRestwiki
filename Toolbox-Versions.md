The _RRest_ toolbox is a continually evolving resource, with new versions made available from time to time. This page is designed to answer the questions _Which version should I use?_, and _What's the difference?_.

The answers to these questions depend on whether you want to use _RRest_ to perform new studies, or to replicate existing studies:

## Performing new studies

If you are using _RRest_ to perform new studies then you should use the most recent version (_i.e._ the highest-numbered version). This is because over time the toolbox evolves to provide increased functionality, and to incorporate suggested changes from the research community. Therefore, if you use an older version, then your analysis will be based on at best an incomplete understanding of the state-of-the-art, and at worst an incorrect understanding of the state-of-the-art.

## Replicating published studies

If you are using _RRest_ to replicate a study from the literature, then you should use the same version as was used for that study. For instance, those gaining familiarity with the toolbox may wish to reproduce the study presented in [this publication](http://peterhcharlton.github.io/RRest/waveform_analysis.html). Version 1 of the toolbox should give an almost exact replication of this study.

However, one should note that there are two potential reasons for discrepancies between the results provided by the toolbox, and those reported in the literature. Firstly, minor changes may be made to a version of the toolbox to ensure that it is easily accessible. This should only have a minor affect on results. Secondly, some publications use only part of the toolbox for their analysis, and fill in the gaps with their own analysis methods. In this instance, the results can be expected to be broadly similar, but not the same.
