The toolbox of algorithms is designed to evaluate the performance of RR algorithms. Reference RRs are required to compare to the RRs estimated by the RR algorithms. The toolbox provides several methods for obtaining reference RRs. These are, in order of preference:

## Extracting RRs from a simultaneous respiratory signal

## Extracting RRs from breath timings

## Extracting RRs from monitor readouts
