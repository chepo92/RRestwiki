# What is RRest?

This Wiki provides acts as a **user manual** for the algorithms presented in this repository.

For those interested in estimating respiratory rate from physiological signals, the wider [Respiratory Rate Estimation project](http://peterhcharlton.github.io/RRest/), of which this is a part, will be of interest. It also contains additional material such as [data](http://peterhcharlton.github.io/RRest/datasets.html) to use with the algorithms, [publications](http://peterhcharlton.github.io/RRest/publications.html) arising from the project, and details of how to [contribute](http://peterhcharlton.github.io/RRest/contributions.html).
