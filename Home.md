# What is RRest
RRest is a toolbox of algorithms for estimation of respiratory rate from physiological signals. It is written in Matlab format, and contains a wide range of algorithms previously reported in the literature.

<a name="what_does" />
# What does RRest do?
RRest estimates respiratory rate from windows of electrocardiogram (ECG) and pulse oximetry (photoplethysmogram, PPG) signals. It also estimates a reference respiratory rate from a simultaneous respiratory signal, such as an Impedance Pneumography signal.

This Wiki provides acts as a **user manual** for the algorithms presented in this repository.

For those interested in estimating respiratory rate from physiological signals, the wider [Respiratory Rate Estimation project](http://peterhcharlton.github.io/RRest/), of which this is a part, will be of interest. It also contains additional material such as [data](http://peterhcharlton.github.io/RRest/datasets.html) to use with the algorithms, [publications](http://peterhcharlton.github.io/RRest/publications.html) arising from the project, and details of how to [contribute](http://peterhcharlton.github.io/RRest/contributions.html).
